# misakachan
misakachan is a modern manga reader that can be run on any computer with Java! 

It's 2017, and there still isn't a nice, updated manga reader for folks who read manga on their computers. We're left using programs that look and feel like they were designed 5+ years ago (mostly because, well, they were) or just browsing laggy aggregate sites who use ugly and clunky readers to maximize their ad revenue.

Mobile apps are way better than anything available for computer users, and misakachan hopes to close that gap!

## Features
- Runs in your web browser so you can resize & zoom as much as you like!

### Planned Features

- Vertical (one long page) & horizontal (page by page) reading modes
