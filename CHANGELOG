0.0.14 - Jan 23 2017
- added button to go to page top/bottom
- fixed search bar centering, it was slightly off
- added a cute loading page for when things are being downloaded from websites
- added automatic changelog fetching and display

0.0.13 - Jan 22 2017
- worked on some more styling
- added my own version of momentum scrolling on WASD/Arrow Keys - actually was a huge pain to code haha
- multithreaded page crawling - HUGE PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT!!!!!! I was super surprised at how much faster it got! A 36 page chapter of Railgun from MangaHere took ~13 seconds to load before; multithreaded, it loads all 36 pages in under a second!

0.0.12 - Jan 22 2017
- added auto SASS formatting builder to eclipse project - it doesn't run on auto build b/c it does some weird stuff if it does
- converted old style.css to SASS - first time using SASS, pretty cool stuff
- removed source mapping for SASS - not doing anything complex enough to need it lol
- fixed extra padding at bottom of image divs - was an issue with vertical-align
- switched to more modularized var naming for scss _colors
- as a side note, until release I will only be using the "PATCH" part of semantic versioning. No point doing "MINOR" patches when misaka isn't ready yet anyways and I'm working on this solo :P

0.0.11 - Jan 20 2017
- recoded BakaUpdateSearcher to search directly within the site instead of using google
- so far it seems to search with pretty great accuracy - first checks for direct phrase matches, and then compares between those by finding the shortest edit distance

0.0.10 - Jan 19 2017
- updated readme.md
- coded some stuff to search for manga on baka-updates
- currently prone to rate-limiting b/c it's parsing google. 
-- Will consider recoding to use baka-updates search interface (but will need to think about how to determine which link is the right one). Tired now though so I'm going to sleep lol
